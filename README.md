# Ghost BunnyCDN Perma-Cache Purger

## Overview

This project acts as a proxy between a Ghost CMS instance and BunnyCDN. It efficiently forwards client requests to Ghost CMS and handles the responses. While doing so, it monitors responses for the [`X-Cache-Invalidate` header](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/570), which signals the need to purge the cache.

In this project specifically, it is used to purge the cache of a specified BunnyCDN pull zone. This functionality ensures that the cache remains synchronized with the latest content updates from Ghost CMS.

Additionally, the tool sets the client's IP address as the `X-Forwarded-For` header in the request to Ghost. This is necessary since Bunny.net tries to set their edge servers' IP addresses as the client's IP address, which can cause issues with Ghost's rate limiting.

Originally developed as part of the BunnyCDN Perma-Cache integration at [Magic Pages](https://magicpages.co), a managed Ghost CMS hosting service, this tool can also help self-hosters using BunnyCDN to keep their cache up-to-date with their Ghost CMS instance.

While designed for use within a Docker Compose environment, other usage configurations are technically possible but not tested.

### Setting up BunnyCDN
If you don't have BunnyCDN set up yet, you can follow the tutorial [on the Magic Pages blog](https://www.magicpages.co/blog/setting-up-bunnycdn-with-ghost-cms/) to get started.

## Usage

The `magicpages/bunnycdn-perma-cache-purger` Docker image is available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/magicpages/bunnycdn-perma-cache-purger). It can be used to deploy the proxy as part of a Docker Compose stack alongside Ghost.

### Environment Variables

#### Required variables

- `GHOST_URL`: The URL of your Ghost CMS instance. Ideally, the hostname of your Ghost container and the port it listens on (e.g., `http://ghost:2368`).
- `BUNNYCDN_API_KEY`: Your BunnyCDN API key.
- `BUNNYCDN_PULL_ZONE_ID`: The ID of the BunnyCDN pull zone that you wish to purge.

#### Optional variables
- `PORT`: The port on which the proxy listens for incoming requests. Defaults to `3000`.
- `DEBUG`: Set to `true` to enable debug logging. Defaults to `false`.
- `BUNNYCDN_PURGE_OLD_CACHE`: Set to `true`to enable deleting old cache files from the storage zone.
- `BUNNYCDN_STORAGE_ZONE_NAME`: Required if `BUNNYCDN_PURGE_OLD_CACHE` is set to `true`. The name of the BunnyCDN storage zone connected to the pull zone.
- `BUNNYCDN_STORAGE_ZONE_PASSWORD`: Required if `BUNNYCDN_PURGE_OLD_CACHE` is set to `true`. The password of the BunnyCDN storage zone connected to the pull zone. This differs from the API key. See [Bunny's Edge Storage API documentation](https://docs.bunny.net/reference/storage-api) for more information.

These variables must be set in the Docker Compose file or as part of your Docker container configuration.

### Example Docker Compose Configuration

The `docker-compose.yml` is a functional example of how to deploy Ghost, MySQL, and the BunnyCDN Perma-Cache Purger as part of a Docker Compose stack.

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  mysql:
    image: mysql:8
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
      MYSQL_DATABASE: ghost
      MYSQL_USER: ghost
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: ghost
    volumes:
      - mysql_data:/var/lib/mysql
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "mysqladmin", "ping", "-h", "localhost"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 5
      start_period: 10s

  ghost:
    image: ghost:latest
    environment:
      url: http://localhost:2368
      database__client: mysql
      database__connection__host: mysql
      database__connection__user: ghost
      database__connection__password: ghost
      database__connection__database: ghost
    volumes:
      - ghost_data:/var/lib/ghost/content
    depends_on:
      mysql:
        condition: service_healthy

  bunnycdn-perma-cache-purger:
    image: magicpages/bunnycdn-perma-cache-purger:latest
    environment:
      GHOST_URL: http://ghost:2368
      BUNNYCDN_API_KEY: your_bunnycdn_api_key
      BUNNYCDN_PULL_ZONE_ID: your_pull_zone_id
      BUNNYCDN_PURGE_OLD_CACHE: "true"
      BUNNYCDN_STORAGE_ZONE_NAME: your_storage_zone_name
      BUNNYCDN_STORAGE_ZONE_PASSWORD: your_storage_zone_password
    depends_on:
      ghost:
        condition: service_started
    ports:
      - "2368:3000"

volumes:
  ghost_data:
  mysql_data:
```

In this example, the Ghost CMS instance is accessible at `http://localhost:2368`. Port `2368` is usually the default port on which Ghost listens, but since we want to catch the `X-Cache-Invalidate` header, we don't expose Ghost directly. Instead, the proxy listens on that port and forwards requests to Ghost.

## How It Works
In a nutshell, this proxy forwards all incoming requests to the Ghost instance that's specified in the `GHOST_URL` environment variable. All responses from Ghost are forwarded back to the client, while the proxy monitors the responses for the `X-Cache-Invalidate` header.

If the header is present, the proxy sends a purge request to the BunnyCDN API to clear the cache of the specified pull zone. If `BUNNYCDN_PURGE_OLD_CACHE` is set to `true`, it also deletes old directories from the specified storage zone to manage storage costs effectively.

### Under the Hood
The proxy is built using Node.js and a simple Express server. Nothing fancy, just a few lines of code to handle the requests and responses.

And yes, that is the exact code that's running in production at Magic Pages ðŸ˜‰
